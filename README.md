# Oh snap, here comes DATBOI!
DATBOI is an attempt to create an open-source and *safe* alternative to current router standards. Python will communicate with both the router and C to monitor internet traffic via [HTTPS](https://techterms.com/definition/https). Contrary to normal standards, it will enforce this rule and hide the [SSID](https://techterms.com/definition/ssid) of the router from normal view. DATBOI will also be more secure by not allowing for backwards compatibility with older schemas that other devices follow.

# Operation
Currently, DATBOI is not suitable for use yet. Check back soon™
